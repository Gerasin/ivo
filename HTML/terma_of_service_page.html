                            <p><small>Address:</small> 2372 Morse Avenue City, Irvine, California 92614 <br>
                            <small>Lessor:</small> 2372 Morse Avenue, LLC, (DBA Irvine Virtual Office). <br>
                            <small>Lessee:</small>  The individual or entity subscribing for services from Irvine Virtual Offices as described below. <br>
                            By agreeing to the Terms of this Services you agree that you are engaging only in lawful business activity.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Lessee agrees to pay to Irvine Virtual Office (hereafter "IVO"), a basic monthly service charge in the amount of $35 per month, due and payable on the first day of each month, for the duration of this service agreement lease.  Unless a longer term is agree to by Lessee, then this lease shall be a month to month lease, and may be cancelled at any time by the Lessee, subject to the cancellation terms.  If Lessee prepays for any period of services, then the term of this lease shall be considered to run throughout the entire term which has been prepaid.  If Lessee cancels services prior to running of the term of this agreement, then Lessee shall not be entitled to a refund of any of the pre-paid portion of the fee. </li>
                                <li>Upon cancellation of the Lease by the Lessee, billable services will continue for the reminder of that month wherein cancellation occurs, plus an additional 30 days.</li>
                                <li>The total monthly service charge, including charges for any additional services not included in the basic monthly service fee, shall be billed automatically and electronically to Lessee’s credit card of choice, or through PayPal, as selected by Lessee.</li>
                                <li>The Lessee’s basic monthly service charge for receiving incoming mail shall include the receiving and holding of mail addressed to the Lessee during the term of this agreement. </li>
                                <li>Lessee will be responsible for picking up his or her own mail. However, mail can be forwarded to Lessee upon request, where such forwarded mail shall include an additional basic charge for shipping and handling, and postage, etc. Generally, however, Lessee authorizes IVO to handle, receive, hold and forward Lessee's mail, as Lessee directs, and based on IVO's discretion. IVO may refuse any mail or packages for Lessee if IVO believes for any reason that said mail is dangerous or of suspicious origin.  In such an event, IVO shall notify Lessee immediately.</li>
                                <li>The fee for Mail Forwarding shall be an additional fee of $30 per month, which shall be billable together with the monthly service charge, according to the prices set forth from time to time on the website for current tenant services, plus any fees for boxes, envelopes and postage used for the purpose of forwarding Lessee's mail. 
                                The fee for Mail Processing shall be $1.00 per page of process mail.  Mail Processing shall involve the opening, scanning and emailing of scanned contents to Lessee.  After mail is scanned and the images sent to the Lessee, then the opened mail shall be forwarded to Lessee's designated mail forwarding address. <br>
                                Lessees subscribing to Mail Processing service must also subscribe to Mail Forwarding, so that upon the opening and scanning of Lessee's mail, IVO shall reseal or package the mail, and then forward the opened and repackaged mail to Lessee.  Postage and packaging the forwarded, processed mail shall be completed at an extra charge. <br>
                                If the opened mail cannot be scanned due to the nature of the contents, or if it is a package containing tangible goods, then IVO is hereby authorized to open the package, determine its contents, and then notify Lessee of the general nature and approximate description of the contents.  This service will be completed at a cost of $5.00 per package which is opened, analyzed and when the description of the contents sent to Lessee by email. <br>
                                If you subscribe to Mail Processing, then you, as Lessee, hereby grant to IVO, the limited power of attorney to open your private personal or business mail, to scan it, and to send those images to you via email, or by phone call. </li>
